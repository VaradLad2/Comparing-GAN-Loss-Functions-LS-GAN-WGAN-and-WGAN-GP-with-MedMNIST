Comparing GAN Loss Functions: LS-GAN, WGAN, and WGAN-GP
Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have transformed the field of image generation. The choice of loss function greatly impacts the quality of generated images. In this study, we compare three popular GAN loss functions — Least Squares GAN (LS-GAN), Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) — using the MedMNIST dataset.
Experiment Setup
•	Dataset: MedMNIST (Medical Image Classification Dataset)
•	GAN Variants:
o	LS-GAN: Minimizes the squared difference between real and fake outputs.
o	WGAN: Optimizes the Wasserstein distance for improved gradient flow.
o	WGAN-GP: Introduces a gradient penalty for greater training stability.
•	Training: 50 epochs for each model.
•	Evaluation Metrics:
o	Inception Score (IS): Higher scores indicate better diversity and image quality.
o	Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): Lower scores indicate closer similarity to real images.
o	Visual Inspection: Manual comparison of generated samples.
Results & Analysis
1.	Inception Score (Higher is better)
o	LS-GAN: 1.75
o	WGAN: 2.07 (Best)
o	WGAN-GP: 2.05
WGAN achieves the highest Inception Score, suggesting it produces the most diverse and high-quality images.
2.	Fréchet Inception Distance (Lower is better)
o	LS-GAN: 349.45
o	WGAN: 358.07
o	WGAN-GP: 349.25 (Best)
WGAN-GP obtains the lowest FID score, meaning its generated images are closest to real images.
3.	Visual Inspection
Images generated by each model are shown below for visual comparison.

Visual Results
•	LS-GAN: Produces blurry images with limited detail.
•	WGAN: Generates sharper, more structured images.
•	WGAN-GP: Produces sharp, detailed images with improved training stability.
Key Takeaways
•	LS-GAN underperforms in both Inception Score and FID, resulting in lower-quality outputs.
•	WGAN creates diverse and high-quality images but with a slightly higher FID.
•	WGAN-GP achieves the best balance, offering low FID, sharp images, and stable training.
Conclusion
Based on our experiments, WGAN-GP proves to be the most effective choice for training GANs on medical image datasets. It enhances training stability, produces high-quality images, and maintains diversity.
